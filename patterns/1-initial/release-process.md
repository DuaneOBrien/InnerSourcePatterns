## Title

Standard Release Process/Published Artifacts

## Patlet

Teams may be reluctant to use InnerSource projects that they are unfamiliar with when there is no clear release process apparent in the repository.
Providing clear release notes and a published artifact (binary, docker image, jar, etc) gives people confidence you are publishing a quality product.

## Problem

The common code in the shared repository doesn't have a published artifact or publicly viewable release process.

## Context

It is common practice in Open Source projects to have releases, with release notes documenting breaking changes,
new features, etc along with either a published binary or link to a Docker image. This practice may not be as
transparent or well documented/visible for InnerSource projects, modules, etc. Providing robust release notes
along with a published artifact that is the result of a clearly document and visible release process builds trust and confidence in your project.

## Forces

- Difficult for organizations that don't have a central CI/CD system
- Adds the burden of publishing release notes
- Becomes more difficult if the organization does not provide an internal location to host artifacts

## Solution

- CI/Delivery Pipeline is located within your repo to build artifacts (binary, docker image, jar, etc)
- Release notes generated by CI system at build time
- Common / shared place to host all built artifacts

## Resulting Context

Teams who come across your project will see published release notes and gain confidence in your tool.
Also, published artifacts make using your product easier and quicker to adopt.
