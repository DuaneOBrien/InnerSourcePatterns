## Title

_Contracted Contributor_ (aka _Free Electron_)

## Problem

Company A has started an InnerSource initiative. One of the goals for this
initiative is to foster innovation by allowing every associate to voluntarily
contribute to InnerSource projects, regardless of topic and business unit.
After a year, only a few voluntary contributions have been received. While
engaging with potential individual contributors, the _Dedicated Community
Leader_ determined that the main problem was that the contributors respective
line managers did not allow them to contribute.

As a result, the total number of contributors remained small and progress was
not as fast as expected by top level management. Furthermore, contributions
mostly originated in the same business unit the Dedicated Community Leader
belonged to.  Innovation did not happen in the expected scale. Top management
is no longer convinced that InnerSource yields the expected benefits and
abandons the initiative altogether.

## Context

- Top level management was on board with and is supporting the InnerSource
  initiative. For them, InnerSource initiative is just one of many initiatives
  to foster innovation. They are funding InnerSource with money and capacity
  for community leaders and are giving autonomy as for how the budget is spent.
  They are also limiting the breadth and duration of the initiative and
  partake in periodic reviews until there is proof that it yields the
  expected results. Top level management has announced their support for
  InnerSource on various company internal meetings, but has not empowered
  or incentivised mid-level managers to allow their employees to
  participate in cross-divisional InnerSource activities.
- The capacity of every associate is usually allocated to non InnerSource
  projects for 100 %.
- Cross organizational collaboration is not the norm.
- Line managers usually do not have targets outside of their own organisation.
- Contributions to InnerSource projects are expected to be made during working
  hours, not during free time.

## Forces

- Managers of business units are held accountable for their results. Letting
  their staff participate in InnerSource activities not contributing to his
  organization would effectively reduce the capacity of his unit. This will
  likely make it harder for the managers to reach or exceed their goals.
- The performance review of all employees is based on what their line managers
  think they should do. Line managers (and HR) need to consider InnerSource
  activities as career relevant or else, the performance of employees
  participating in InnerSource as perceived by their line managers will suffer.
- The more time an associate spends on contributions to an InnerSource project
  which does not benefit his day-to-day work, the more will the workload for
  his teammates in his business unit increase.
- The individual contributor would like to participate to enhance his
  professional network within the company and gain knowledge and experience
  with both the InnerSource method and the technical area he makes a
  contribution to.
- The less executive air cover a line manager perceives he has, the less likely
  is he or she to have his or her staff participate in InnerSource activities
  which contribute to another business unit.
- The less transparency and control a line manager has of work done by one of
  subordinates InnerSource, the less likely is he or she to allow him or her to
  contribute.
- The less formal work in InnerSource is managed and organised, the less likely
  a line manager accustomed to formal processes is to sign off on one of his
  employees contributing to InnerSource.

## Solution

- Set up a governance office (_tbd. pattern link_) with central funding and
  budgetary independence from business units.
- The governance office sets up formal contracting between associate and his
  line management stating the ground rules for the associate participating in
  the InnerSource project. The contracting specifies a maximum percentage of
  the associates work time in InnerSource. The contracting also makes it clear
  that business usually takes precendence over work in InnerSource and that it
  is not required to work in InnerSource for the maximum percentage specified.
  The contracting is signed by the governance office, the community leader and
  the contributors line manager.
- The governance office refunds the business unit of the contributor for the
  time he participates in the InnerSource project with central funding. While
  that does not solve the business units problems related to meeting project
  deadlines and capacity for most business units, it does send a clear message
  to line managers that InnerSource has executive air cover and is something
  they expect from their organisation.
- The governance office mediates between the associate and his line management
  in case of conflict regarding the participation in the InnerSource project.
- The [[Dedicated Community Leader]] participates in or provides input for the
  performance review of every associate contracted for more than 20 % of his
  capacity.

## Resulting Context

- Allocation of corporate funds to business units for reimbursement of 
  development capacity sets a clear sign that InnerSource is deemed valuable
  by the organization and that it has executive air cover.
- A formal contracting signals that work in InnerSource is managed 
  professionally and inspires trust.
- A formal contracting provides a basis for resolving conflict related to
  participation in InnerSource activities.
- A formal contracting increases transparency and provides a better overview
  about the associate's available capacity for his business unit and
  InnerSource projects, thus reducing the risk of "over-booked/planned
  capacity".
- With a stable group of contributors, it is more likely that some of them will
  eventually achieve trusted committer status.
