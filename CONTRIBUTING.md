# Contributing to the InnerSource Patterns

The goal of the InnerSource patterns working group is to collect, document, and publish InnerSource best practices. To make the best practices easy to comprehend, evaluate, and apply, we codify them in a specific structure - [the patterns format](meta/pattern-template.md). More infos on the working group can be found in our [README.md](README.md) file.

For this working group to strive, we welcome your contribution - be it small or huge.


## How to Contribute?

Please consider contributing in the following ways:

1. **Share your thoughts & spark discussion**. A fresh perspective, an interesting thought, or an early novel idea can spark discussions and yield unforeseeable results. We invite you to share your thoughts on InnerSource-related topics at any time by [creating an issue](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/new), [via Slack, or our patterns office hours](#how-to-get-in-touch).

2. **Read & improve existing patterns.** If you want to get started, we encourage you to read through the existing patterns and materials in this repository. Found a misleading phrase or phony grammar? A mistake in the content? Let us know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/new) or directly propose your fix as a pull request.

3. **Review open pull requests.** Even without knowing all the specifics of the patterns working group, your feedback on existing [pull requests](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/labels/type%20-%20Content%20work) (especially those propising changes to pattern contents) will be valuable to its authors: As somebody who wants to learn more about InnerSource, you can give input from the perspective of a future reader. As somebody with own InnerSource experiences, you can share your experience with the authors.

4. **Contribute a new pattern.** A key contribution you can make is to document an InnerSource best practice you experienced or know about. We defined different maturity levels for the contents in this repository: First time contributors should aim for maturity levels `1: initial` (for unstructured experience reports or what we call donuts - patterns with missing pieces) and `2: structured` (for best practices adhering to the patterns format and following basic writing style conventions). Our [Contributor Handbook](meta/contributor-handbook.md) discusses all this in more detail. You don't feel ready yet to contribute a new pattern? Please start a discussion by [creating an issue](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/new).

5. **Be a patterns advocate.** The patterns will become better and cover more topics the more people contribute their perspective and experience. A colleague told you about a novel InnerSource best practice? Please invite her/him to contribute to this repository!
