## Title
Duplicated Projects

## Patlet
Forthcoming ...

## Problem
* Multiple teams are doing InnerSource, but they don't want to work together.
* Multiple teams are working on the same product.  How do they merge?

## Story (Optional)
e.g. Splunk. 

* 4 unique products have significant overlap.  Discovered after inner sourcing.
* This could apply to more than just InnerSource situations

## Context
* Multiple teams (doing inner source or not) are trying to tackle the same problem.
* Managers want to run the project in their way.
* Manager B gets upset if something Manager A does breaks B's team.
* It's easier to be mean when you're not face-to-face.

## Forces
* People don't want to lose their jobs (or reason for existence).
* Mangers can be territorial with their project.
* People rewrite 100% rather than using the 80% that is already there (even though it would be better to inner source).
* Related to the not invented here pattern.
* Related to the common requirements pattern.
* It's like buying another company and having duplicate projects.

## Solutions
* We are lacking a solution of establishing a baseline (which of the 4 projects is the baseline for the merge)?
* An open and transparent process CI/CD, requirements backlog, deployment, etc.
* Anyone participates in the process in the same way.
* Project lead is assisted by the former managers.
* Move away from (benevolent) dictator (e.g. eng. manager?).  Could this be hard to acheive?
* Experience has shown that if people are in the same room then things tend to go better.  Not so much by email/phone.  You are nicer if you see the people.

## Resulting Context
* Managers have been convinced to be a part of the solution.
* Managers are bought in to a process where they have left some control but still retain influence.

## Status
* Unproven
* Draft

## Author(s)
Often, this is yourself; If you need to, find someone in the InnerSource Commons to be the nominal author (As Told To); Could also be no-one if you do not want to take on authorship (common with a donut looking for a solution)

## Acknowledgements
Include those who assisted in helping with this pattern - both for attribution and for possible future follow up. Though optional, most patterns should list who helped in their creation.
