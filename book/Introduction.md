Welcome to the **InnerSource Patterns book**.

This book contains InnerSource best practices codified in a specific format to make it easy to understand, evaluate, and reuse them. We call this reuse format a **pattern**.

These patterns have been collected by the [InnerSource Commons](http://innersourcecommons.org) community over many years. The most mature of these patterns have been published in this book.

In this introduction we explain [what InnerSource is](#what-is-innersource), [what a pattern is](#what-are-innersource-patterns), and [how to use these patterns](#how-can-you-use-innersource-patterns) in your organization.

If you are using InnerSource in your company already and want to contribute your experiences to this book we would love to [welcome your contributions](../book/contribute-to-this-book.md)!

## What is InnerSource?

We define InnerSource as:

> The use of open source principles and practices for software development within the confines of a company.

InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. As developers have become accustomed to working on world class open source software, there is a strong desire to bring those practices back inside the firewall and apply them to software that companies may be reluctant to release.

For companies building mostly closed source software, InnerSource can be a great tool to help break down silos, encourage internal collaboration, accelerate new engineer on-boarding, and identify opportunities to contribute software back to the open source world.

## What are InnerSource Patterns?

Patterns are a way of describing a repeatable, proven solution to a problem with a context. They follow a simple form that helps people wanting to implement the solution to understand the constraints on the problem, the forces that must be balanced and the resulting context (the situation you are left with after the solution is applied).

In inner sourcing, patterns can provide a way for the InnerSource Commons participants to concisely share information with each other, improving the practice of inner sourcing. Each of the patterns are divided into Title, Problem Statement, Context, Forces, and Solutions as their main sections.

## How can you use InnerSource Patterns?

Patterns must be used in a thoughtful manner. They cannot be blindly applied. In most cases, you will need to adapt the given solution to your own situation; but the information given in the pattern, defining the context (immovable constraints) and forces (constraints that can be changed and balanced against each other), should help you do this. Note that you will also need to determine if there are additional constraints (company context and company forces) that apply to your particular company/organization that must be added to the pattern (as a kind of filter). These additional constraints may require additional solution steps to be applied.

The pattern form is useful for describing proven patterns but it can also be used for *brainstorming solutions* where patterns are not yet established, since the form gives a structured way for thinking about a problem. You could also create a *donut pattern* (filling in the problem, context, forces and resulting context fields but leaving the solution blank) as a way of asking the InnerSource Commons community for help (to find a proven solution or to brainstorm things to try).

## Credits

This book is the result of many years of work from countless [Open Source Contributors](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/graphs/contributors) from around the world. Their willingness to openly share the challenges that they faced in their companies, and how InnerSource has helped them address those challenges, make this book such a valuable resource for others on their InnerSource journey.

We want to specifically mention the InnerSource Patterns Working Group. They have nurtured the quality of the InnerSource Patterns and helped others to contribute. Lastly they also compiled a selection of available patterns into this book.
