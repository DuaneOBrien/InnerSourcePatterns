This book contains the most mature InnerSource Patterns collected by the [InnerSource Commons][isc-website].

These patterns are:

> InnerSource best practices codified in a specific format to make it easy to understand, evaluate, and reuse them.

Below you find [what a pattern is](#what-are-innersource-patterns), and [how to use these patterns](#how-can-you-use-innersource-patterns) in your organization.

## What are InnerSource Patterns?

Patterns are a way of describing a repeatable, proven solution to a problem with a context. They follow a simple form that helps people wanting to implement the solution to understand the constraints on the problem, the forces that must be balanced and the resulting context (the situation you are left with after the solution is applied). In inner sourcing, patterns can provide a way for the InnerSource Commons participants to concisely share information with each other, improving the practice of inner sourcing. Each of the patterns are divided into Title, Problem Statement, Context, Forces, and Solutions as their main sections.

## How can you use InnerSource Patterns?

Patterns must be used in a thoughtful manner. They cannot be blindly applied. In most cases, you will need to adapt the given solution to your own situation; but the information given in the pattern, defining the context (immovable constraints) and forces (constraints that can be changed and balanced against each other), should help you do this. Note that you will also need to determine if there are additional constraints (company context and company forces) that apply to your particular company/organization that must be added to the pattern (as a kind of filter). These additional constraints may require additional solution steps to be applied.

The pattern form is useful for describing proven patterns but it can also be used for *brainstorming solutions* where patterns are not yet established, since the form gives a structured way for thinking about a problem. You could also create a *donut pattern* (filling in the problem, context, forces and resulting context fields but leaving the solution blank) as a way of asking the InnerSource Commons community for help (to find a proven solution or to brainstorm things to try).
