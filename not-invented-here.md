## Title  
Not Invented Here

## Problem
Perfectly good solutions are being rejected because of Not Invented Here. Engineers and their managers will choose to implement functionality themselves first, even if an alternative exists.

## Context
Where does the problem exist? what are the pre-conditions?

## Forces
What makes the problem difficult? What are the trade-offs? These are constraints that can be changed at a cost.

## Sketch (optional)
visual illustration

## Solutions
Verified resolutions and possible resolutions to the problem

## Desired Resulting Context
What is the situation after the problem has been solved

## Rationale (optional)  

## Known instances (optional)  

## Status  
Brainstormed solution (not proven), a donut (no solution), a proven solution, a reviewed pattern, an untested idea, an unreviewed draft of a proven solution

## Author(s)
Often, this is yourself; If you need to, find someone in the InnerSource Commons to be the nominal author (As Told To); Could also be no-one if you do not want to take on authorship (common with a donut looking for a solution)

## Acknowledgements (optional)
Include those who assisted in helping with this pattern - both for attribution and for possible future follow up
